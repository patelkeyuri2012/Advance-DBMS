- Write a query to identify lock in the database and generate formatted output for better understanding.



SELECT * FROM student_master
WHERE stdid = 1
FOR UPDATE;

select sid, username from v$session;

SELECT 
    s.sid AS "Session ID",
    s.serial# AS "Serial Number",
    s.username AS "Username",
    l.type AS "Lock Type",
    l.lmode AS "Lock Mode",
    l.request AS "Request Mode",
    l.id1 AS "ID1 (Object ID)",
    l.id2 AS "ID2 (Sub-object ID)"
FROM 
    v$session s
JOIN 
    v$lock l ON s.sid = l.sid
WHERE 
    s.sid = 251;

COMMIT;  or ROLLBACK;


LOCK TABLE student_master IN EXCLUSIVE MODE;


SELECT * FROM student_master

    dba_objects o ON l.id1 = o.object_id

COMMIT;  or ROLLBACK;



TX: Transactional lock
Row: Row-level lock
Table: Table-level lock

0: No lock
1: Null
2: Row-S, Shared row lock
3: Row-X, Exclusive row lock
4: Share lock
5: Exclusive lock
