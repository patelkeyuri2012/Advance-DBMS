- Write query to find out hit ratio for the data buffer cache and write your conclusion.â€‹
 
SELECT
  (1 - (v3.value / (v1.value + v2.value))) * 100 AS data_buffer_cache_hit_ratio
FROM 
  v$sysstat v1,
  v$sysstat v2,
  v$sysstat v3
WHERE 
  v1.name = 'db block gets'
AND 
  v2.name = 'consistent gets'
AND  
  v3.name = 'physical reads';




				 
Conclusion: A hit ratio of data buffer cache (above 95%) indicates that the cache is effective. The hit ratio for the data buffer cache  should be > 95%. 
            If it is less than 95% then we need to resize the database buffer cache.
