- Write minimum three query to find out fragmentation in database. 
- Derive your conclusion for the result of the query.


Query 1: Free Space Distribution by Segment Type

SELECT 
    s.SEGMENT_TYPE,
    SUM(fs.BLOCKS) AS TOTAL_FREE_BLOCKS
FROM 
    DBA_FREE_SPACE fs
JOIN 
    DBA_SEGMENTS s ON fs.TABLESPACE_NAME = s.TABLESPACE_NAME
GROUP BY 
    s.SEGMENT_TYPE;


Query 2: Largest Free Blocks per Tablespace

SELECT 
    fs.TABLESPACE_NAME,
    MAX(fs.BLOCKS) AS LARGEST_FREE_BLOCKS
FROM 
    DBA_FREE_SPACE fs
GROUP BY 
    fs.TABLESPACE_NAME;


Query 3: Segments with Insufficient Free Space

SELECT 
    '********FREE********',
    TABLESPACE_NAME,
    BLOCK_ID,
    BLOCKS
FROM 
    DBA_FREE_SPACE
WHERE 
    TABLESPACE_NAME = 'STUD'
UNION
SELECT 
    '****USED****',
    TABLESPACE_NAME,
    BLOCK_ID,
    BLOCKS
FROM 
    DBA_EXTENTS 
WHERE 
    TABLESPACE_NAME = 'STUD';




1. Free Space Distribution by Segment Type: Summarizes the total free blocks available, grouped by segment type (e.g., tables, indexes).
2. Largest Free Blocks per Tablespace: Identifies the largest contiguous free blocks available in each tablespace.
3. Segments with Insufficient Free Space: Lists segments that have less free space than the number of blocks they occupy, indicating potential fragmentation.
